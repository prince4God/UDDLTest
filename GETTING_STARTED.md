# Getting Started Guide


## Installing Relevant Open Source Tools.
1. Install a current version of the Java JDK. You can download [Temurin, an open source JDK from this page](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/).
2. Install [Gradle](https://gradle.org). There is a version installed with Eclipse but it isn't current - and you'll need the current version. It should be version 7.6. Note that the current version is 8.x. You can install the current version but you'll need to make sure you select v 7.6 in Eclipse later on.
3. Make sure Gradle can find Java. See the [Troubleshooting Guide](TROUBLESHOOTING.md) section  [Errors that Just Won't Go Away](https://github.com/Epistimis/UDDL/blob/master/TROUBLESHOOTING.md#errors-that-just-wont-go-away)  and the section [Problems with Gradle](https://github.com/Epistimis/UDDL/blob/master/TROUBLESHOOTING.md#problems-with-gradle) for instructions on what to do.
4. Install [Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org). Download the installer - you will need to click through several screens to pick the installer appropriate for you. You should be downloading Eclipse IDE 2022-12. 
When you start the installer, select **Eclipse IDE for Java and DSL Developers** (see screenshot)

After selecting that, you should be presented witha dialog where you can select the JDK and installation folder:

1. Open Eclipse and select Help -> Eclipse Marketplace. This will bring up a dialog from which you can select additional tools to install. Install **Eclipse OCL 6.x**. Also install **EMF Compare**. Restart Eclipse after the installs complete. 

2. You also need to install **[XText2Langium](https://github.com/TypeFox/xtext2langium)**. In Eclipse, select Help -> Install New Software. 
You should see something like this:

Clicke **Add** and fill in the form like this:
* Name: XText2Langium
* Location: https://typefox.github.io/xtext2langium/download/updates/v0.4.0/

Then click **Add** on that dialog and **Apply and Close**. That defines the feature source. You should now be back to this dialog:

4. Select **XText2Langium** in the `Work with` field, then select XText2Langium Generator Fragment as in the screenshot. Then select **Finish** to install it. If you cannot click on **Finish**, select **Next** to bring up the next dialog from which you can select **Finish**

## Working on this code
When you opened Eclipse, you created a workspace. That workspace is where Eclipse expects the code you edit to be located. When you pull this repo from Github,
you can put it anywhere you want. ***I strongly recommend putting it in the Eclipse workspace you just created.*** While this is not absolutely required, if you 
do not do this, you will discover that when you edit files, they don't get stored where you think they should be (in the directory where the repo is). Instead, they
can get stored in the workspace. This will cause all sorts of mysterious build problems because the code that is being built won't be the code you are looking at.

You need 2 repos:
`com.epistimis.uddl.query`
`com.epistimis.uddl`

They should be built in that order

After you pull this repo, you need to build the existing code. In Eclipse:

1. Select File -> Open Projects from File System and click on the **Directory** button to navigate to the root directory of the repo you just pulled 

![Screenshot 2023-01-14 at 2 43 30 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/120406738/212500480-8401fbc2-7e56-4719-b9f8-a2b2faec757f.png)

Then click **Open**. This will then populate the dialog like this:

![Screenshot 2023-01-14 at 2 43 58 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/120406738/212500507-27433f5c-a80d-41aa-8ead-ae0a0791960b.png)

You should see the parent project and 8 nested projects. They should all be selected. Then click **Finish**. 

2. The repository does not store every file that the project uses. Some need to be generated. Before you do anything else, you must make sure the **Java Build Path** is properly set up for *every* project. Right click on each project in the Project Explorer and select **Properties** from the context menu:

![Screenshot 2023-01-15 at 8 15 32 AM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/120406738/212552934-e319f454-ee76-425e-ac69-535771c5e519.png)

The select **Java Build Path** (you can type it in the text field at the upper left of the dialog to narrow the choices) and then select the **Libraries** tab. Under the **Classpath** choice you should see **Plug-in Dependencies**.

![Screenshot 2023-01-15 at 8 16 34 AM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/120406738/212552898-99a08014-8109-4ae1-9512-b3160c06f918.png)

If you do not, click the **Add Library...** button to get:

![Screenshot 2023-01-15 at 8 16 56 AM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/120406738/212552883-f4d887d3-526a-4c30-9b8d-b621e8f48d48.png)

Select **Plug-in Dependencies** in the dialog, then click **Next** and **Finish**

3. Open the xtext file for each repo you downloaded. They are located as follows:
* UDDL: /com.epistimis.uddl/src/com/epistimis/uddl/Uddl.xtext (see screenshot)
* UDDL Query: /com.epistimis.uddl.query/src/com/epistimis/uddl/query/Query.xtext
* FACE: /com.epistimis.face/src/com/epistimis/face/Face.xtext
* FACE Templates: /com.epistimis.face.template/src/com/epistimis/face/template/Template.xtext

![Screenshot 2023-01-14 at 5 42 21 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/120406738/212508222-bf4b4003-a1e4-4c32-b1e8-067ce2daed04.png)

then right click in the edit window to bring up the context menu and select Run As -> Generate XText Artifacts

![Screenshot 2023-01-14 at 5 42 44 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/120406738/212508587-4423c56a-28e9-41de-920d-46c2eced07ca.png)

You may see a dialog box with a warning indicating there are errors. If you do, just click 'Proceed' 
You should see results in the Console pane similar to those in the screenshot. ***If you do not, create an issue and include the content of your console window so I can figure out what happened***

# Start the Editor you just created
If everything completed successfully, the Problems pane will not show any Errors (Warnings and Infos are expected). If this is not the case, then create an issue and post a screenshot of the errors you still have. Attach a copy of the Console log output to the issue.

If  you were successful, you will be able to launch a second copy of Eclipse that will run the code you just generated. 
To do that select Run -> Run Configurations. You will see something like this:

![Screenshot 2023-01-14 at 5 50 38 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/120406738/212510514-a8ee4b8a-4867-455a-93f2-66e6e4f6910a.png)

Select Eclipse Application and then click the 'New' icon (the leftmost icon in the icon row in the upper left - it has the + sign) to create a new launch configuration.
You can use the defaults (rename it if you want) - just click **Run**. This will launch a second Eclipse. 

In that second Eclipse, 
1. create a new blank (not Java) project (File -> New -> Project or File->New->Other->General->Project)  and  click **Next**. (If you have the option to create a Uddl Project, you can do that.)
1. Give it a name and click **Finish**. 
1. Then copy (do not link) the following file from the first Eclipse to the new project: 
```
/com.epistimis.uddl.tests/src/com/epistimis/uddl/tests/UDDL_SDM_Min.uddl
```
1. Open the UDDL file in the new project. Eclipse should ask if you want to convert this to an XText project - select 'Yes'. The UDDL file should be editable (not greyed out). If it is not editable, then create an Issue and attach a screenshot of the second Eclipse, a screenshot of the first Eclipse showing the Error pane content, and a text file with the first Eclipse console log output.
1. If the UDDL is editable, you should also see an outline in the Outline pane that shows the structure of the UDDL file. If you do not, the create an Issue and attach screenshots and a console log file.
2. If the UDDL file is editable and you see an Outline, then select the edit window, and use Cmd-Shift-F on Mac or Alt-Shift-F on Windows to format the file. 

If you have problems, see [Troubleshooting](TROUBLESHOOTING.md)

## Modifying the code

At this point, you've got enough working that you can begin modifying code. See the issues for what needs to be done.

Before you do much coding, consider reading the [Notes on Tools](NOTES_ON_TOOLS.md) in addition to the tool doc itself.
