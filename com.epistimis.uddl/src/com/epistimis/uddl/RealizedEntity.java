	/**
	 * NOTE: (P/L/C) Composition element specialization is interpreted as follows:
	 * If a (P/L/C) Composition element specializes, it must specialize a Composition element from an Entity at the same (P/L/C)
	 * level.  Only realization can bring Compositions from C->L  or L->P.  Specialization also means that the specialized element
	 * is not inherited 'as is' - rather, the specialization overrides whatever would have been inherited.
	 *
	 * That means that the RealizedEntity must account for this when working through the hierarchy. To do that:
	 *
	 * 1) recursively walk up the realizes/specializes chains. These should be self consistent - a realizes-specializes path should arrive at the
	 * same place as a specializes-realizes path (e.g. Given PlatformEntity PE2 that specializes PlatformEntity PE1 and realizes LogicalEntity LE2,
	 * then LE2 must specialize LE1, and PE1 must realize LE1. ) If they are not self consistent, this is an error (these errors should be caught by
	 * the OCL - see logical.ocl and platform.ocl)
	 *
	 * 2) Once reaching the root PlatformEntity (the one that does not specialize anything), then realize all of its Composition elements.
	 *
	 * 3) Then recursively pop out of /work down the PlatformEntity specializes hierarchy. At each new level, override any Composition element
	 * realizations we already have if they are specialized at this level. Then add any new Composition elements found at this level that do not
	 * specialize.
	 *
	 * Once all the recursion is done, the PlatformEntity should be fully realized - except for the type.
	 *
	 * 4) Once all the PlatformEntities are realized, we can go back and link the type for each. This requires that we keep track of the
	 * original relationship between PlatformEntity and RealizedEntity.
