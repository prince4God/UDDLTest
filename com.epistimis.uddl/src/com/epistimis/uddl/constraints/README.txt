The OCL Constraints in this directory differ from the OCL constraints as they appear in the FACE 3.0 Technical Standard.  
The OCL constraints used in the Conformance Test Suite had to be modified to align with the OCL Engine used in the Eclipse Kepler development environment.  
These OCL constraints and those found in the FACE Technical Standard should be functionally equivalent.
